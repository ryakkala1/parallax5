			<p>The Nike Air Force One has become one of the most prevalent and well-known shoes of the last few years, people from every different group of people have worn and rocked these shoes in an infinite combination of outfits. The different versions of the shoe have created an unmatched hype and collectors frenzy for the shoe that helps its legacy transcend across generations. It was created by a man named Bruce Kilgore in 1982 as a basketball shoe “initially only available as a high top, was striking for its hiking-boot-inspired cues and uniquely chunky sole.” The original shoe colors were gray soles and white exterior throughout keeping it clean and simple.</p>

		<p>After its 1982 release, the Air Force One was almost discontinued but due to an initiative called “color of the month” created and pitched to the Nike management by the owners of a shoe shop in Baltimore the shoe was saved. The shoe went from its original white to adding different colors to the shoe every month starting with the inaugural blue and brown bottom shoes as pictured below. These shoes quickly became popular again preparing them to rise again, especially in specific diaspora markets in New York.</p>

		<p>The AF1 returned in 1986 to the East Coast after its heroic revival and a redone shape. This is when limited edition shoes began to gain popularity as it was a way to increase demand for the shoes and keep things interesting for the East Coast market.</p>

		<p>The Air Force one has little to no marketing, the original ads featured popular NBA players of the time. It had an original inner-city fan base but the shoe has grown to include a market of every “ race, gender, and class.” The Forces still use little to no marketing to push out new models of their shoes and have created an organic demand for themselves unparalleled in history and only rivaled by a few other models.</p>

		<p>In the mid to late 90s, Nike introduced Gold Air Force Ones for special occasions and created the Jewel Swoosh shoes(pictured below). They also changed the materials of the shoes in the 2000s. Shoes were made with more effective materials such as Foamposite, Liquid Metal, and Flyknit. A variety of new colors and models kept streaming in. In the early 2000s, the creation of the nikeiD led to a tremendous amount of variations as users now had the opportunity to personalize the shoes to their liking.</p>

		<p>In 2001 Nike introduced women’s sizing to Air Force Ones. To the untrained eye the shape looked the same but there were several nuances that changed the shoe to fit a women’s foot and create a design unique to women. The women’s shoe is .5 centimeters larger and the heel is slightly narrower. The women’s shoe colors are softer and create more feminine hues. Designs with flowers and other designs are added to the shoes giving them a unique touch. They also recycle old designs that were specifically for men and customize them for women.

		<p>In 2014 the shape of the Air Force was redesigned by several notable figures. In 1982, the running tech inside the basketball shoes changed in the Air Force setting the course of basketball shoe design through history. 30 years later redesigned the shoe for women and changed the style into an iconic trend that women adopted as their own. The new design of the Air Force ones held on to the fundamentals of the 1982 designs while creating a new and lighter silhouette that gave it femine looks and features. “The original Air Force 1 Low and High are joined by the all new Air Force 1 Ultra, Ultra Mid and Nike Lunar Force 1 Sky Hi to bring the legendary silhouette to places no force has gone before. (pictured below).” Designs featuring figures such as Kyrie Irving. The trilogy of Nike + R.T. Air Force 1 Collection also began to emerge at this time creating more variation and leading to more designers taking an interest in the shoes.

		<p>In 2020 a color changing Air Force 1 was created that was UV reactive. The shoe was designed by the original creator of the Air Force One Bruce Kilogore. He composed two different versions of the shoe but the one that went to market was a shoe with “white leather panels, a monochromatic midsole combined with a semi-transparent ice blue sole.” The shoe changes its look depending on the environment the user is in, the amount of UV rays around changes the shoe in several ways. The upper part of the shoe changes when hit with UV rays from white to multicolor, while the lower part of the shoe is more subtle and changes slower when exposed to the rays. The shoe when completely changed has the colors of yellow, blue, fuchsia, and lilac. Once the user is back inside the colors start to fade until the shoe is back in the sun under UV rays.

		<p> The Louis Vuitton x Nike Air Force 1’s were seen as iconic in the summer of 2021 where they first debuted and at the final LV runway show again. The shoes create a collaboration between 3 major brands: Louis Vuitton, Virgil Abloh, and Nike to create a one of king ringarde shoe. Its drama and flare are what sets it apart in the crowd and defines the elasticity and amiability of the fashion world. “There's co-branded text done up in Abloh's signature style, quotation marks, monogrammed canvas, succulent leather uppers, references to bootleg culture — everything anyone needs for a killer collab.” On January 19, Sotheby’s auction place would debut the shoes on its website with bids starting at $2000 and up. The shoe was fleeting as it was gone in a flurry creating the ultimate buzz and demand for the shoe while it was still around and will go down in history as a valuable collectors item.
